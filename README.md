# Project Title



Web-App Dashboard



# How it works



The webpage acts as a dashboard for a webapp with user informations



- The first section is a chart's section that shows 4 different traffics



  - The line chart's data can be changed based on user preference to

    - Hourly,

    - Daily,

    - Weekly or

    - Monthly



- The second section is a member's section that shows new members and recent activities



- The third section is a message form that can be used to send messages to available users



  - The user name input field shows available users based on the text entered



  - When the 'send' button is pressed, the form displays error/success messages based on the contents entered

    - _Since this is a front-end project no message gets actually sent_



- The last section is a settings's section



  - The user settings are stored using the built in 'local storage' system
  
  - The stored settings can be cleared by pressing the 'cancel' button
