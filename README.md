# Project Title

Web-App Dashboard

# How it works

The webpage acts as a dashboard for a webapp with user informations

1. The first section is a chart's section that shows 4 different traffics

- The line chart's data can be changed based on user preference to
  - Hourly,
  - Daily,
  - Weekly or
  - Monthly

2. The second section is a member's section that shows new members and recent activities

3. The third section is a message form that can be used to send messages to available users

- The user name input field shows available users based on the text entered

- When the 'send' button is pressed, the form displays error/success messages based on the contents entered
  - _Since this is a front-end project no message gets actually sent_

4. The last section is a settings's section

- The user settings are stored using the built in 'local storage' system
